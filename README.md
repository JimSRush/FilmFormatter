# FilmFormatter
A simple program to format a film schedule from an excel spreadsheet, ready for publication. Written for the NZIFF.
Every year, the International Film Festival puts on over two thousand screenings. Formatting the screening information for publication is an incredibly manual and laborious task. 

This program opens the spreadsheet with the screening information, parses the session information & generates two publication ready text files per festival.
